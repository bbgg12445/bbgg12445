well hello everybody i'd like to thank you for coming on to our call today we're going to be talking about how to win the ten thousand pound start at race uh i'm james schumacher ceo of the startup race and um uh this this startup race is being uh created um with my co-founders dan uh mike closer and topic is on the call today so it's uh um yeah it's a combination of a uh yeah a lot of effort we did our first race last probably it was 2019 just before club it came along but anyway uh so just a reminder of the process so the idea was that um way back in april we gave people the opportunity to benefit from their resources on lean stack so they could learn startup secrets they could model their business validate their uh assumptions have an opportunity to build a team if they're just a solo founder create what we call a minimum revenue products because in business we need to have something to sell uh and then the ten thousand pound startup rate uh begins uh on the 14th of june which is next week uh and then work out how to sell and generate more revenue outperform the other startup racers and win ten thousand pound cash somebody has to win it uh i wonder who it's going to be um and so i always like to remind people that there's direct correlation between how much effort you put into something how committed you are to winning uh to actually actually winning so the person who does puts the most time in works hardest will generally win the uh ten thousand pounds start at race um and um yeah so this is there's this law universal law the people who put the most effort in generally win and so you need to make a decision whether that is you or not um now of course the goal for us is to motivate or a whole bunch of entrepreneurs um to um grow their businesses to generate more money than they would if they were uh you know on their own uh and so that the idea is that you take part in the startup race um but um even if you don't win you'll be in a far better position you will have grown your business and um uh you know you're regenerating revenue and uh possibly um with the exit investors that are going to watch the the race later on you might get an investor deal even if you don't win the ten thousand pound start at race so um i'm just going to talk about the tasks that i need to complete uh before the 14th of june uh now some of you may already have done some of these uh so one of the things that we need you to do is to read the playbooks on on lean stack so that is the foundations playbook the business modeling playbook just to help i mean these are the most important ones just to help you understand um you know the most important aspects of your business and then you need to validate your riskiest assumptions and then as we said before create a minimum revenue product and i'm just going to talk through that a little bit just so you understand what we mean by a minimum revenue product uh way back in 2010 i was in a internet marketing group and the people who are running the group are teaching us that need to create an offer then you and you put it on you know it's a long form sales page effectively then you sell it and only if people actually started paying you money for the product or the service or the program would you go on to build it so this is way back in 2010 then last moria very recently when he was here visiting us in edinburgh he repeatedly said that you know people buy a demo so create a demo uh generally people are happy just looking at a demo before they buy it and if you think about what elon musk did with the first tesla he showed people a demo and then said who wants to buy it and then they had the waiting list of people who wanted to buy it they paid money up front and then he went on and used their money to actually build the business it's called their in some ways you could call it the customer funded business okay so you don't necessarily need to have anything with your complex or sophisticated uh you know for you to be able to sell it and i had a call earlier on today with an entrepreneur who is just set on the second version of their mobile app the first one has all serious problems and need to spend thousands upon thousands of pounds try to fix it and i haven't even sold anything to make any revenue oh do not make the mistakes that most people make um all right so explain the minimum revenue products and this is different from the minimum viable products okay so the minimum revenue product is the smallest version of a product that meets enough early customers need to motivate them to pay you money for it okay that's the keywords there's very something very small that people pay you money for uh and i'll give you an example a focus on on selling a minimum revenue product means entrepreneurs prove custom demand increase company valuation and speed up uh raising investment okay here are some examples of a minimum revenue product uh pop-up juice bar one of the easiest things an entrepreneur can do just create something very simple and just seeing if people want to buy it i should have done this way back when i was trying to do a juicing business um after i'd done my motorbike business important motorbikes from los angeles to edinburgh and i wasted six months doing a marketing plan i should have just had a pop-up juice bar in the meadows here in edinburgh another example of minimum revenue products is what we call a pre-order discount and as you can see here's an example uh you know canvas white shoes pre-order now and very often um businesses will do that especially on in the game industry uh there's here's another example the previous one was for a physical product this is for a pre-order on assassi subscription so you you know you you buy early you get discount uh even before the product is ready you can maybe people could be paying you money uh and then you yeah you build it another minimum revenue product is what we call early access uh to a beta version and as you can see this is um call of duty vanguard pre-order get an open beta early access so again people are paying money even will help you know before the product is ready and earlier on i was talking to mike and myself one of our friends he did a crowdfunding campaign to produce some headphones and mike paid for the headphones but he didn't receive them uh for two years now there's a number of complex um things that affected that one of them was coved disrupting and i think it was probably the these things came from china so they probably got caught up in the uh panama canal was it the panama canal or the the other one um anyway the one in um uh so is suicidal that's right but yeah you can you can sell early access to a beta version or you can just sell an hour of your time yeah you can use calendly just connect it to a stripe account and ask people to pay you for an hour of your time it's very simple and entrepreneurs generally try to overcome complicate things get caught up in perfectionitis and we want the startup race to prevent you from becoming infected uh with this um perfectionist virus okay so some tasks that you need to complete before the 14th of june uh um i think i've gone through this already haven't i um yeah so read the playbooks on need second if not validate your business model assumptions create minimum revenue products and then incorporate a business here in the uk with one director okay and once you've done that open a business account uh if you have more than one director in your business it will take a lot longer to open a bank account and of course that's going to delay your participation in the ten thousand starter race uh as you can see here there is a link friendlyscore.com and you can find out what supported banks are please do not open a business bank account with wise because unfortunately why it is not compatible with our systems that we're going to be using um to track each person's progress now it's important that you do not generate well we're just making a statement okay that no revenue will be valid until the business bank account is opened okay and um so any revenue or any suggestion that you've made money before your business bank account is opened will not be counted um as part of your progress in the startup race all right tasks um is there anything i've missed guys before i move on to the next section dan or mike okay tasks to complete after the 14th of june uh these what we would like to say generally create creating the ability to sell your minimum revenue products so this is the landing page this is strike uh payment system or paypal or whatever other payment channel payment gateway you're going to be using and a buy button so you don't necessarily need to do this until after the 14th of june we would recommend you don't um and then uh and then start connect connect finally score to your bank account i'll i'll show you what that looks like in a minute and uh and then start selling your minimum revenue products and then check your progress on the ten thousand pound startup raise dashboard and then finally we'd like you to complete a type form we will send out the link later on a tight form with a unique identifier and screenshots off of your bank account and links to your company on company's house okay now a little caveat here it's very important if you are an international entrepreneur you want to take part in the ten thousand pound startup rates and you have not got your startup or innovative visa yet there are some important things to know uh what you can and can't do okay so you can get a registered address maybe an accountancy firm or a legal firm for your business to be registered at you can incorporate a business with one director from abroad generally open the business bank account but do not start selling until you have your startup or innovative visa approved okay so even if you use uh you have everything set up so you can you can you know comply with the the rules and for the ten thousand pound startup race but you don't start selling until you have your visa so that might mean you know you don't start until one month uh you don't start selling until the end of july or august or whatever but of course you can still you can still um win the startup race by um selling more than anybody else and this is the date that the ten thousand pound startup rate is going to finish it's going to finish on the 24th of december and then we'll have a purse a period where we determine we conduct our due diligence to make sure that the person who has generated the most revenue hasn't cheated um and um and so that will take a period of time so the 10 000 pounds will be awarded in the new year 2023 okay so that will give you your new business a great boost uh in 2023. all right so a little um definition of what we mean by revenue okay here's an image that my co-founder dan uh found for me so generally we when we talk about revenue we mean cash inflows into the business okay so this is from cash sales now this doesn't have to be the folding money or the metal money this can be money um or cash that's generated through stripe or paypal or any other payment gateway that you have on your website or landing page okay or it can be receipts from trade customers um it cannot be sales or spare assets it cannot be investment or share capital it cannot be personal funds that you've invested in the business it cannot be receipt of any bank loan government grants or receipts from factoring whatever they are i'm not entirely sure what they are other means of of um well other things that we would consider revenue or crowdfunding so if you do a crowdfunding campaign and people pay you it's a bit like the uh paying early to get early to get the early access or what we call deferred revenue anything that dan or mike would like to add to this anything i've missed uh yeah so contest winnings do not work either so if you enter a contest say a hackathon or a business plan contest and you win yeah so just we're just about to go into that so cash prize from competitions any investment from personal or angels a loan or grant or spell sale of spare assets so um thanks for that mike so these things will appear on your will go through your bank account and therefore are potentially would get picked up and therefore it's important that you identify where you have received investment or you have invested or got a loan or grant etc etc yeah so we would recommend people use a tool like um life plan and then your balance sheet you need to measure or you need to uh recognize um these assets uh correctly uh and um yeah so they don't get confused with the um the money that we want you to generate from selling your products and services because if you sell your products and services you make it's nice to make money but you increase the value of your business okay all right so i'm just gonna uh show our dashboard now so maybe dan you want to talk through this sure um so this here is what you'll see as a racer um and in effect what what they'll be a central dashboard whereby all your data um from from your bank statements from your corporate bank statements are consolidated into one dashboard where you can track your metrics now this is on the basis of a sort of six month um race with three months of the way through and i'll run through each section so we're going to provide you guys with anonymized numbers so if you see in the top left there this is the dashboard for 17214 so if somebody else and somebody else who was let's say 17168 were to put their number in this would all refresh and it would come up with what their number is now it tells you what date the the um report is up to and what week you're on of the race this is those two items are quite important for other areas of the dashboard which i'll run through now so below that is a table which shows the ranking and that's who's in number one 10 25 and 50 and what their total cash in is and then also what position you're in and what your total cash in is so you can get a bit of an understanding of how you compare to your to the other races and competitors so you can get a better understanding of where you need to be now this information then all ties through to this line graph over on the right and so you can see the line graph demonstrates people who are in position 1 10 25 50 and then your position number four now in reality this line graph is going to be have a lot more uh movement in it and so it'll be a lot easier to decipher the practice data that i used was all quite close and but that should be able to tell you more so you'll be able to then see where you are versus them and if you're sort of on a hot on a steep trajectory and therefore potentially gonna overtake those individuals and climb now down in the middle there's a table the middle table middle up sorry yeah middle top this table here is a month by month summary so it looks at what month you're on works out the monthly cash in and then it provides a monthly change so that you can start tracking you know what you how is how are your operations accelerating or are you doing something that have you started doing something that's not working therefore you should stop doing it and do what you did before or are you doing something right that you should keep doing now in in the table below that this is a summary of in in the the rows are the different uh firstly this week so what's its summary of the week's uh cash flow that's reported here what the week average is i all the weeks that have gone before what you had got as an average the racer week average so this is all the races within the competition what they averaged and then a top three average i all of those that are in the top three what they averaged for that week the next bit of and so we do that for sales and then we also do that for your two largest outflows so that you can understand what are the largest things that you're currently spending money on and how much are you spending compared to the previous weeks or how much you spending compared to other races in the top three because it you might decide oh i actually need to spend more money on those things to grow or you might think to yourself actually i'm spending money there where i could actually be using that money to grow instead so you can consider are those the best use of my funds for growth then over from that are all the outflows so this is a summation of all cash outflows so i t services other expenses um it will include uh insurance yeah insurances rent if you have any that sort of stuff um and then and so again those categories are all there these things are all color coded based on green is improvement orange is not much change and red is a decrease um and lastly we have the net cash flow this here is your is what you're doing in terms of value generally improving your cash position this isn't gonna affect whether you win or not it the the competition is judged on cash sales i.e money in your bank account from selling what you uh your product or service but it's important for you unders to understand your net cash flow so you can make sure that you're constantly tweaking and using your money effectively to grow and don't run out of runway and burn out midway through the race so at the top in the top right we have an overall summary position of where you are so the overall thing it has different depending on what position you're in it gives you a different rating so this person here is in position number four so it tells them they're in the top five tells them what position they're in tells them that they've moved from number seven which is a movement of three places which is pretty good and then the change in cash in is 144k which they've their movement from this week versus last week so that's a overview of what the dashboard will look like obviously with each different person these numbers are going to change your numbers will change based on what you how your business um progresses these numbers were i the numbers are quite high in here because i wanted to pack it full of as much data as possible so these aren't necessarily the expectation of where you'd be in month three but it's a great thing to aspire to kill thanks dan any comments mike anything then i no i think that's good i mean obviously um i think a couple of things that are important to mention to people is that um the um there's gonna be another dashboard for angels um and maybe you go over this later james but the angels will have peer in yeah like that and um they will have peer in in other words they'll be able to see the top contenders and they can um if they ask we can put them in touch with you um or with with the startup but um you know you will not be assigned an angel as a mentor uh for example or anything like that i mean you're not going to be assigned um an angel investor and they won't be able to see everybody's data right team so you should explain how that works a little bit so yeah so we only make um uh public the people at the top of the of the leaderboard as we call it uh you might find yourself at the bottom uh you know temporarily maybe you'll be motivated to get find your way up there up the leaderboard is a mother of invention uh and so yeah the we only really want to make the people at the top public uh so it's like our premier league what we call our premier league so we're not going to be making public uh you know the divisions below um the um this league table and the idea is that um you know an angel investor they're interested in entrepreneurs who can execute who can sell uh sell stuff effectively um and um yeah so going back to what mike was saying you know there's been a lot of opportunity for people to get mentoring from the lean stack platform as i said before we gave you access way back in april for people to learn the startup secrets from some of the best minds uh in the world on how to build a startup uh you still have the opportunity uh to read the playbooks to read the stories of the two entrepreneurs and to make you know and to learn and benefit from them you still have the opportunity to model your business using the lean canvas and i wouldn't i wouldn't say that the canvas is just a one-time thing you only do it way back in april you know you actually could be using the canvas um and the traction roadmap which i'm not actually showing you here um throughout throughout the process throughout their six months because it's all about learning it's all about innovating and trying to find um ways to generate more money so there's been a lot of uh and of course you still have um the opportunity to go back and watch uh the videos that we recorded on our youtube channel and we have a lot of information in there um having said that there is an opportunity if you if you want to have a one-to-one uh with me to ask any questions to make sure everything's set up correctly um i think i uh i did send that out before uh via email um there is a charge for that uh because obviously my time is uh precious to me and uh so if you want to benefit from that coaching call then across 100 pounds okay so that's up for you to the site but generally the system means that uh the playbooks the business model canvas the traction roadmap are pretty much they're the best things that you could be benefiting from um to help you uh build a successful business there are also lots of videos by ash moria uh in in lean stack that you can watch so you can understand all these things as well um so yeah i guess it's an opportunity for unless mike or dan have anything else to add we can open up for questions okay right then let's move on to questions yeah i think there's one here i'll let him ask it it looks like it's from joshua so joshua do you want to go ahead and ask the question you have first okay so my question is about are we around based on sales revenue or ranks based on revenue after expenses have been fit well dan you talked about this earlier dan do you want to you want to remind everybody what you said so it's just purely on sales so that those expenses is just one clean easy place so that you can see them so that's just for your own information the sales is what we'll be ranking you on okay thank you very much uh so then robert's asked about lean stack will we send them a link will they be grouped together um yeah robert uh that probably needs to be clarified maybe robert could clarify that question for us yeah could you tell us what you mean robert or just clarify it somewhat oh oh yeah yeah sure i i don't know lean stack so uh so we just log on to lean stack and then um what do we do is go into the website yeah so this is the this is the lean stack platform okay and um the this is the main channel in which we're going to be communicating with everybody that's taking part in startup race uh so for instance if you're going to be uh sending us a link to your um your website or whatever then we'll be using the uh the forum um which is here and there's a number of um topics so you can see the list of supported banks that mike is put in here there's an opportunity for you i ask people to you know share their personal profile uh introductions this is when we were talking about the um before the hackathon anyway it's an opportunity for uh for you to use this forum uh perhaps you wanna we have we have uh 397 participants um signed up on this forum our email list uh for the ten thousand pound startup race is twelve hundred 1200 but anyway we have nearly 400 people in here that you can um uh you can contact now of course you everybody has to sign the rules um in order to remain in this in this um hackathon uh then the code of conduct as well okay and now what else so we have a number you can always keep an eye out for the events uh we have this is today's event here and next uh on thursday night we've got a an event with mike masdek so it's an opportunity and you can watch all the recordings of the previous events you can download the slides you can um identities uh so here we have the replay and the slides so this is uh your one-stop shop to to catch up with a lot of stuff that we've been talking about uh now at the bottom this is where you get your um uh well in my view anyway this is where you can see the playbooks okay uh and you can you can just click in here uh you can read the articles you can watch the videos um so you there's a lot of opportunities to catch up here um [Music] yeah so anything that hopefully answers some that question i see that um and has uh has another call has her hands up hi yes um i just wanted to ask a question and i'm not sure whether my product is suitable for this platform but i'm going to ask it anyway and then that will clarify me is hackathon uh trying to create products like platforms or apps or can any product be part of this process uh yeah i mean pretty much you need to be solving a problem that people will pay you money for so it can be a physical product such as a set of sneakers or it could be a membership site uh so let's say you know you feel that um the summer's here you know let's have a let's start a hill walking um obviously it's just over the top of my head so you could sell a membership site or it could be a saf product anything really that um it's solving a problem uh that people have uh like a beverage should be suitable sure absolutely you could be you could be smelly you should be selling um uh i mean we haven't really specified you could be i mean there's no reason why you as long as it's not breaking the law i'm just selling whiskey to adults it's okay if you sell whiskey to your young people then obviously not okay yeah i understand that yeah is there room for a second question or oh yeah sure um if the revenue because i've tested my product is in cash or this they'll count as revenue or does it have to be like uh bought for a website platform does it have to be ordered online and paid through paypal and then that will count uh well maybe dan can answer that question um well firstly one of the issues would be you the 100 pound cap so i don't know how far your your testing goes as it were um now given given that the as as it's all through bank statements it it's it's only going to be through the likes of paypal stripe or some form of um [Music] pos such as if you used uh i've forgotten all of the the names of them the the different point of sales uh engines that i can't remember now paypal do their own um okay can anybody else there's this appsumo the appsumo event oh no no i don't know nothing about that just cash all right no no sorry you know the um the little card readers that yeah no no no i haven't been using any card i know i don't know which one you're talking about okay no sorry because because the issue is we can't verify that the cash is sales as easily as we can if you use something like a point of sales machine um how about if i start with zero does it have to be up to 100 or is it from zero to 100 um i don't really understand what it means yeah so um the the cap um the legibility to enter this is that i do not have more of revenue more than 100 pounds so if i didn't have any money would i still pay sure yeah if you guys uh most people have got zero okay all right that's that's good so okay i don't i don't go above 100 well i've made you kind of you know made thousands and then cleared you back then put it and opened up a new bank account and started from zero effectively okay i can't i can't do that you're saying yes so if you've made under 100 pounds and you opened new bank account that's fine however if you had if you'd set something up and you had made you know thousands of pounds selling it and then you set up a new bank account and sell it um under a new company name in that bank account you've already made over 100 pounds from that if that makes sense okay i get it would there be anyone i could talk to further after this yeah i mean you can always pick your yeah yeah you can put your question in the uh you can contact us in the forum on linkstack or just send an email okay all right thank you thank you very much i see uh george had a question he asked he recently moved to glasgow is he no longer eligible for this i think he means for the race well we don't we don't prejudice against the ouijas yeah i yeah yeah you can live wherever you pretty much live wherever you want you can live on a yacht and um if i look to pre if you like uh that's a great thing about one of the uk company um i see and jason has a question no no jay's asked hers already okay you already got it okay sorry i'm just going through the chat i see pri's hand is up you know meet yourself pre hey um so i have a question um so if i am physically selling product like in a stall or something and i get cash um how am i going to you know sort of deposit that into the bank account as as revenue well i think dan has already addressed that i mean it's um i believe so yeah all right it's not something yeah do you want it i mean can you explain it i'd recommend you use a point of sale machine so some point of sale machines will allow you to take take cash through we we need to identify what the point of sale machine is but at this point in time we're only we're only using the likes of stripe paypal and point of sales machines that are taking card okay because uh those machines they you have to like pay sort of some commission so um i mean it's a small commission but usually um we have two options so what you're saying is um it's uh the machines are the only way to yeah it's one of the limitations of the race i guess okay okay um okay thank you for that the other thing is i don't know why i have 24th june in my mind so can you tell me like uh the race starts from 14th to june right the revenue i think i probably confused you earlier on pre i'm sorry about that okay thank you thank you marily you got your hands up yes james my question is about the application that we need to link it uh to our bank account uh you will tell us how uh which is application and how we can link it uh [Music] yeah so about that do you want to answer that or yeah yeah sure so um you won't need to do too much on your side so the in terms of the application the application is called friendly school we'll have an account on friendly friendlyscore and what we'll do is you'll give us your email address we'll send you an email with a with a link when you click on the link it will prompt you to open up your open banking you log into your open banking and then confirm that you're happy to share the data with friendly score and we do it all from there the only thing we need from you is an email and we need you to also then click on the link sign in and approve the the data being shared it won't give us access to your banking or anything well it'll give us access to see the data the transactions but we won't have access to any of the the the functions such as payments etc okay okay thank you then thank you marily okay mccartney carty cayenne hello um thanks for the opportunity it's basically just have a question i didn't i think i know the answer but before i rule myself out i thought i'll ask um so we have been developing a product for a year and a half and we kind of launched last november and we had two people who held this kind of developer product from whom we got a revenue of about 200 300 pounds last month so does that mean i won't be eligible for this race but we have properly launched only from this month uh well to make it fair from everybody we put the limit as 100 i'm afraid totally understand thank you yeah no worries all right ash you got your hand up hello hi sorry so just just trying to retreat and get into my brain so got company registered open the bank account checked it on the clear score website which one is compatible um it's my revenue is less than 100 pounds till date connected my landing page with stripe so all the payment is going to go through the stripe so the only thing remains before 14th of june is to connect the account with clearscore so that you guys have access is there anything else i have to do before that yeah so from that list you've mentioned i believe the only thing left is to do the the friendly school connection we'll send those emails out within the next um week or so so that you everybody has them prior to the race and they can then sign up when they've got their bank account ready etcetera for you that means you can sign up straight away effectively um james is there anything that i've missed from that that needs to be added to the list um no i mean as i said i guess the i mean i i mean maybe i could just um i can share my screen again uh okay so let me go back to the what we were recommending people do um so you've read the playbooks on lean stack cash you validated your business model assumptions you created the minimum revenue product yeah uh you've incorporated the business uh with one director yeah you open a business bank account yeah um so after the 14th uh well it doesn't really matter if you've done your landing page or stripe or buy button as long as you don't start selling it um [Music] connect friendly score so we can start um [Music] we can give you the opportunity to do that um [Music] actually do we maybe i made a mistake there do we want people to set this up before the 14th actually or after what did we agree to we'll send the link out but it people can sign up after it it won't be it it won't be times the link won't be time sensitive effectively so we'll in the next in the next week we'll progressively get through people and send the links out but um they'll be you know we won't start counting from until the 14th of june and if anyone makes revenue after that they've you know they've missed potential time as it were because the race has a set end date and they've started later in terms of revenue okay so i think the most the most important thing is you don't start selling your minimum revenue product until after the 14th of june um because obviously you get close to the limit uh and then check your progress on the dashboard um and then so i guess this is you know we need we would like you to complete a type form uh just so that we can connect your unique identifier and uh screenshots of your bank account and links to the company and companies house just so that we can just verify and know who you are essentially okay so so you need the the unique identifier number which we got when we incorporated the company and right now sorry the unique identifier is on the dashboard it's um something we're going to be creating okay so it's kind of going to be this number up here okay okay yeah okay uh yes we don't want people to fall through the gaps and um to have missed anything uh and we do want to make sure that people have done things correctly so that's why we're doing it that way okay all right we're approaching half eight do we have any other hands up or last last chance for questions from anyone i don't i don't see any other hands up myself all right cool well um as i said before uh you can you can you can schedule a call one-to-one coaching call to talk all this through if you want uh or you can send an email um and then i'll answer uh try try to answer your question or you can put your question in the forum on lean stack as well yeah and and

just to remind you okay this uh this is pretty much a warm-up uh opportunity for you because next year we're going to do a 300 000 startup race and uh the year after that hopefully we'll do a million pound startup race and so that'll be interesting who's going to win the million pound startup rate that'll be a day that'll be an exciting day i also wanted to also just real quick because i've got this question before from people who have been confused just um just kind of remind me just everybody knows there's only one one out one ten thousand pound startup prize so there's no second and third um they'll be we'll announce runner-ups but there's no cash prize related to those um and then also it is a grant from us we are like basically our company is giving away money to to a startup that wins okay so um there's we're not buying equity or it's not a loan or anything it is a grant basically and uh therefore because we're giving money away to startups you know we are setting the rules and we'll make sure everybody you know sticks by those rules so um yeah just to reiterate that because i have got questions from people that um thought there were second and third prizes but i said no that's that's just for the hackathon okay well it's lovely to meet some new people and to see some familiar faces too i look forward to the 14th of june and to see uh who's gonna hustle and uh start selling stuff okay okay we're gonna end the call there uh thank you so much everybody for um for coming on the call uh all the best thank you all cheers
